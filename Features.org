* IDEAS (UNIMPLEMENTED)
  + Wolves?
  + Fishing?
  + Polar bears?
  + Illusioner?
  + Blindness
  + More **bedtime** conditions
  + Wither skeles drop skulls more often if you've killed the dragon
  + Wither is a boss rush?
  + Bone blocks?
  + Killing one vector saves everyone
  + Can we make the lava haste force you to move forward?
  + Lore on items when things happen?
  + Exploding bed always fatal to whoever placed it?
** HATCRAFTER'S IDEAS
   + Polar bears have Haste 3
   + Every hostile mob has a very small chance of dropping a random item
   + Shearing a sheep gives you 2x the wool
   + Shearing a sheep creates an explosion that only damages the
     player and knocks them back
   + Eating food has a slim chance to give the player another random
     food item
   + Every in-game day, all players will use the same skin as a random
     player
   + Vex will occasionally transform into strays
   + Turtle shell and chainmail are the only craftable helmets
   + When the player takes damage, they might drop redstone
     - Excludes damage from fire, lava, poison, and wither
   + Redstone torches drop redstone
   + Creepers spawn with 2 minutes of a random status effect
   + The world starts with an 80x80 world border. At noon, the world
     extends by 16 in all directions
   + Bedrock change
     - **bedrock** only applies to leaves and glass
     - All blocks have a chance to transform into leaves when mined
     - Blocks which **bedrock** formerly applied to have a higher
       chance of transforming into leaves
     - Bedrock can now be mined... veeeeery slowly
     - When bedrock is mined, the player is teleported 72 blocks down
       (Tempting the Void)
   + Leaf blocks have a small chance to drop emeralds
   + Zombies sometimes spawn with a stick with one of the following enchantments
     - Wand of Flame: Fire Aspect I
     - Wand of Force: Knockback II
     - Wand of Slicing: Sharpness III
   + Items destroyed by Curse of Vanishing instead become a random item
   + Dimension Chain - Whenever a player dies, a random player in a
     different dimension has a 35% chance to die as well
   + Stardew Slime Loot - Slimes have an increased loot pool. They may
     drop the following (see chat)
   + Mundane potions can be crafted into gold nuggets
   + Gold nuggets can be eaten for nutrition. They act like sweet
     berries
   + When a player dies, their game is set to a random language
   + When a phantom dies, there's a small chance a random boat will
     spawn
   + All gold tools and armor are significantly buffed and better than
     netherite.
     - Whenever you take damage, all gold items you are carrying have
       a small chance of breaking
       * This effect can also destroy gold ingots, nuggets, blocks,
         and apples
     - Whenever a gold item loses durability, that specific item has a
       small chance of breaking
   + When a player harvests beetroot, small chance a rabbit will spawn
   + When a player damages a zombie pigman, there's a small chance of
     another zombie pigman spawning
   + Pigs sometimes drop brown mushrooms
   + When the gods are pleased and once per night, if all online
     players type a special phrase, then all non-boss mobs will be
     killed. (Purging ritual)
   + Naming a rabbit causes them to stop being a killer rabbit.
     - Named chickens and pufferfish won't explode
     - Named axolotls don't take anyone with them
   + Sometimes Bowser will issue a challenge to the players, rather
     than the gods. Bowser's challenge is much harder than god
     challenges, and Bowser will not punish you for failing. But he
     will reward you for success. Purging ritual cannot be done on
     Bowser nights.
   + If the gods are pleased multiple nights in a row, some effects
     are disabled.
   + If a player is sprinting, there is a small chance an egg is
     thrown at the player's crosshair
   + If a player is wearing iron, gold, diamond, or netherite armor in
     every slot, they gain 1 slowness. This applies even if the player
     is mixing their gear.
   + Players may be forced to ride nearby saddled pigs
   + When a skeleton shoots an egg, there's an increased chance that
     the mob spawned will be a saddled pig named dinnerbone
   + All mobs named Dinnerbone gain levitation
