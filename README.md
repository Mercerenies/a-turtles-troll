# A Turtle's Troll

This is a Minecraft plugin for Paper which introduces several "troll"
mechanics to the survival multiplayer experience. See `Features.org`
for the full feature list.

This is a companion project to [EvanSkiStudios'
Raccoon-Mischief](https://github.com/EvanSkiStudios/Raccoon-Mischief).
Neither directly depends on the other, but they are designed with each
other in mind.

**NOTE:** This plugin is only compatible with Paper. It uses
Paper-specific features not available in Spigot.
