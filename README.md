# A Turtle's Troll

This is a Minecraft plugin for Spigot which introduces several "troll"
mechanics to the survival multiplayer experience. See `Features.org`
for the full feature list.

This is a companion project to [EvanSkiStudios'
Raccoon-Mischief](https://github.com/EvanSkiStudios/Raccoon-Mischief).
Neither directly depends on the other, but they are designed with each
other in mind.

## Building

To build this project, get a compatible version of the Spigot API JAR
and place it in the `lib` directory. Then run `gradle build`.

## Acknowledgments

released under the [MIT License](LICENSE.txt).

* The Kotlin runtime (Included and automatically bundled in the
  produced JAR File)

  API](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/spigot-installation/) (Not
